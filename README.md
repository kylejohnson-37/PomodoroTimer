# PomodoroTimer

For this timer I decided to use Javascript and the jQuery library for the front end, and Python for the backend.

Issues that I ran into:
1. I wasn't super familar with using NPM so I had to do some quick research on that.
2. I was able to make calls to my backend, but the initial set up to allow this took longer than expected. This didn't allow for much programming afterwards.
3. Since I am on vacation and away from my home PC I had to do some set up on the PC available to me.

This was an eye opening and humbling project to work through. Since my current work already has everything I need to begin coding set up, it is not something I do regularly, this is an area I do need to improve on. 


# How To Run:

1. Download/Clone the following project to your local machine (You may have to extract the file if downloaded as a ZIP)
2. Open CMD, and run "cd *the path to the copied code*" (Ex. "cd C:\Users\kylej\Documents\PomodoroTimer-master")
3. Run "node start.js", you should see "Example app listening on port 8000"
4. You can now navigate to "http://localhost:8000/" in Firefox
